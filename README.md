Rota et al (2016) multispecies occupancy model using Turing

## What is this?

This repository contains the Julia code to implement the multispecies occupancy model published by [Rota et al (2016)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12587) in Methods in Ecology and Evolution.
The [Stan code](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.pq624) used these authors to fit the co-occurrence probability of four carnivore species has been adapted to Julia language in order to fit simulated data on two arbitrary species.
